Subfinder  -  subfinder is a subdomain discovery tool that returns valid subdomains for websites, using passive online sources. 
              It has a simple, modular architecture and is optimized for speed. subfinder is built for doing one thing only - passive subdomain enumeration, 
              and it does that very well.

Subjack   -   Subjack is a Subdomain Takeover tool written in Go designed to scan a list of subdomains concurrently and identify ones that are able to be hijacked. 
               With Go's speed and efficiency, this tool really stands out when it comes to mass-testing. 
               Always double check the results manually to rule out false positives.
