If you're new to web security, it can be difficult to know where to begin. That's why we've created this suggested learning path to point you in the right direction. We recommend completing the labs as you go, but don't be afraid to move on to the next topic if you get stuck. You can go back to the more challenging labs once you've developed your skills further.

The aim of this path is to teach you how to attack web applications. To successfully attack and exploit web applications, you need to understand how they work. The first section (Web Fundamentals) will give you all the pre-requisite knowledge on this.

SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.

This project is maintained by Daniel Miessler, Jason Haddix, and g0tmi1k.
